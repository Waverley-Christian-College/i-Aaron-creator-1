## What i have learnt about Github

### **I learnt many new terms such as:**
***Repository***: A place where the project happens, the file that stores all the code and revision history.  

***Cloning***: Cloning in code means to create a local copy on the device. This can be helpful in a lot of ways such as if you experiment with a project but you like a previous verision more.  

***Committing***: How you add the changes you made in a code or new code into the repository.  

***Branches***: Adding branches isolates work that you don't want to merge into the final project yet, allowing to safely experiment with ideas safely.

***Forks***: Like branches, but you make a copy of a repository, and are able to propose changes.
