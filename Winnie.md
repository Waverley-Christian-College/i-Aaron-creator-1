## What I learnt about GitHub

### Repositories
Repositories are like project folders - where you do you work, either by yourself or with others. 

### Branches
Allows you to make copies of your repository to change and experiment with. 

### Forks
Another way to copy a repository, but for someone else's work. 

### Pull Requests
A place for discussion with others about changes that could potentially be made. 

### Issues
A way to track your progress and what you plan to work on.
