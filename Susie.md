## What I have learnt about Github

### **Repository**
Where a project work happens, can collaborate with teammates or work alone. Contains all of the project files and revision history. Can add a README file to describe the project.

### **Branches**
Isolated work that would not be merged into the project. Developing new ideas and experiment in a contained area of the repository. Can be merged into the main repository manually.

### **Cloning**
Clone a repository to create a local copy in your own computer to edit and push larger commits. Not limited in just Github platform.

### **Forks**
Copy a repository and experiment with changes without affecting the original repository. Usually used in contributions to other projects.

### **Commiting and pushing**
Add changes that made in the local machine to repository in Github. Creating a 'checkpoint' for reminding the changes that had done.

### **Pull requests**
Tell others about the changes that wanted to make and ask for feedback and discuss with collaborators. Can be merged into the project when is was ready-to-go.

### **Issues**
A way to track all the tasks that are wanted to work on the project, can allow others to know what are going to be done.
